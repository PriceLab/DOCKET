DOCKET will accelerate the work of researchers who
develop Knowledge Providers by providing a domain-agnostic
and researcher-driven solution to analyze
data to extract knowledge for the Translator
Knowledge Graph (TKG). DOCKET has three main
functions: Overview, Compare and Integrate.

DOCKET Overview will embody a completely
automated workflow going from raw input data to mini knowledge
graphs.

DOCKET Compare will enable comparing two or more versions of
the same data set.

DOCKET Integrate will perform three types of computations.
The first computation is data matching, merging and selecting.
The second computation is sequential integration for different
levels of data. The third computation is to integrate different
datasets from different levels simultaneously.
